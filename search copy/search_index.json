Players can obtain skins in two ways, a drop at the end of a game or a case. Skins are added to the game in the form of larger collections. Collections are packages of skins for multiple different weapons that are added at once. There are eight different skin rarities:</p> <ul> <li>Consumer Grade (grey/white)</li> <li>Industrial Grade (light blue)</li> <li>Mil-Spec (blue)</li> <li>Restricted (purple)</li> <li>Classified (pink)</li> <li>Covert (red)</li> <li>Contraband (yellow)</li> </ul> <p>Every skin also has an exterior wear level, which determines how chipped the skin will be. This does not change with usage in-game:</p> <ul> <li>Factory New (cleanest)</li> <li>Minimal Wear</li> <li>Field-Tested</li> <li>Well-Worn</li> <li>Battle-Scarred (most scratched and torn up)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#cases","title":"Cases","text":"<p>Players have a chance to receive a case after every game.

For example getting kills, planting the bomb, defusing the bomb, and surviving a round will all award money. The amount earned depends on a few factors though. We will go through each aspect of earning money.</p>"},{"location":"#kills","title":"Kills","text":"<p>You will earn money based on how many enemies you killed that round. You will lose money based on how many teammates you kill as well. In short kills are multipliers for money. Each weapon earns a different amount of money but the number of kills multiplies that amount.</p>   | ![A pro player getting 5 kills in a single round](https://i.makeagif.com/media/5-24-2015/3-n2ZK.gif \"A pro player getting 5 kills in a single round\") | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | A pro player getting 5 kills in a single round.                                                                                                       |   <p>For example, one kill with an AK-47 will earn $300 per kill so our money earned in a round would look like this:</p>   | Kills | Total Money Earned | | ----- | ------------------ | | 1x    | $300               | | 2x    | $600               | | 3x    | $900               | | 4x    | $1200              | | 5x    | $1500              |   <p>Each weapon also earns different amounts of money. The general rule is that the more difficult it is to get a kill with a specific weapon, the more money you will earn for a single kill. For example, it is hard to kill an enemy with a shotgun since they have to be close and you have to be lucky with the spread of bullets so the award for a kill is $900. This is in contrast to an 1-hit kill sniper rifle that is effective at nearly every range with an award of $100.</p>"},{"location":"#planting-the-bomb","title":"Planting the Bomb","text":"<p>The main objective in every round of Counter Strike is to plant the bomb on one of the two bombsites, or defuse that bomb after it's been planted.

If the bomb explodes the team gets the normal round win award and if the bomb is defused the team receives an additional $600 for completing the first part of their objective.</p> <p>On the Counter Terrorist Team ('CT Side' for short) they have to stop the Terrorists from planting the bomb and defuse it if it is planted.

Callouts become harder as they get more personalized with each map because it gets harder to remember details on every map. The community may rename callouts for various reasons making it important to communicate to other players to understand where their callouts are. An easy start to making callouts is to follow a basic format like:</p> <ul> <li>\"Area/site\" + \"detailed spot in the area\"</li> <li>Example: \"A ramp\" the A site Ramp</li> <li>Example: \"Connector\" Area that connects A and B sites</li> <li>Example: \"B Tunnels\" A covered area near B site</li> </ul> <p>Callouts are a great tool to use and will help you win games.

A Skybox is a cube that surrounds that map with invisible borders that keep people and items inside the map. However CS2 is a little different with no verticle SkyBox or \"ceilling\" to the map. This allows player to throw utility in the sky and have it not bounce back down from an invisible barrier. The video below shows the use of the skybox and how combining utility with the map is very useful.</p> <p>Boundaries on the map likes walls and boards are useful to bounce utility off of and to shoot through to get ahead of an enemies. Shooting through a wall is called \"WallBanging\" and works for certain surfaces. For example, players can shoot through doors, cars, wood pallets, corners of walls, and thin walls. This can be very useful when you know where someone is or want to stop enemies from peeking angles.</p>"}]}
